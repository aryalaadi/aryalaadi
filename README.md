Hot take:

Daily Reminder, if you want to contribute to open source projects, and
you have to "look" for projects to contribute to, you need to fuck off.
You are NOT supposed to contribute just for the sake of contributing!
This is not a place to pad your resume for the rat race!
You are ONLY supposed to contribute to software that you use and want to see it improve.

Please try to understand and try to follow the freesoftware philosophy.
learn more on https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html

Once you get into the freesoftware ecosystem and actually use the software,
only then you will be able to make meaningful contributions! padding your
github profile with random readme edits or random documentation fixes does
not reflect your abilities as a developer but instead shows your incompetence.

Again! the open source ecosystem and the freesoftware movement is NOT supposed
to be a part of your rat race get a fucking job, stop being so insufferable.
